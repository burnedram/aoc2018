First run
```
./task.py input.txt
```

This will run indefinitly, but will print local minimas along the way.
A local minima can be thought of as the number of character the stars are showing.

Break the program when you think you've found the local minima that is your answer (i.e. a small number) run
```
./task.py input.txt local_minima
```

This will run until that local minima has occured and then print the current starmap before exiting.
